# Contributing to mailchimp-subscribe-form

General workflow:

- Fork the repo
- Commit and push to your forked repo
- Open a pull request

If you're implementing a new feature, even if it's relatively small, it's nice to open an issue before you start so that others know what you're working on and can help make sure you're on the right track.
